# Wargames

The wargames offered by the OverTheWire community can help you to learn and practice security concepts in the form of fun-filled games.

If you have a problem, a question or a suggestion, you can join us on [IRC](http://overthewire.org/about/contact.html).

**!!! Do not file issues for game-related questions. This repository is for the website only !!!**
